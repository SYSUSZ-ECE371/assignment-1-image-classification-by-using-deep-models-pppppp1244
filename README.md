# Image Classification Assignment  

## Project Overview  
This project is an assignment for image classification, consisting of two exercises (EX1 and EX2), which primarily use deep learning models to perform image classification tasks.  

## Project Structure  
- **EX1**: Code and models for the first exercise  
  - `epoch_20.pth`: Model weight file after 20 epochs of training  
  - `ex1_config.py`: Configuration file containing training parameters and model settings  

- **EX2**: Code and models for the second exercise  
  - `best_model.pth`: Model weight file with the best performance  
  - `main.py`: Main program for loading the model and performing image classification prediction  
  - `assignment1.pdf`: Assignment documentation  

## Notes  
Model files (.pth) in this project are managed by Git LFS. Use `git lfs pull` to fetch complete files after cloning.
